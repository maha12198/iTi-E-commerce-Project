The aim of this project is to develop the front-end of a fashion e-commerce website, named La Moda.
The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). 

The libraries/tools used in La Moda website are:
- Fontawesome icons.
- Boxicons.
- Google Fonts.
- The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

It consists of four main parts, which are: The home page, registration pages, product pages, and the cart page.

In the registration, two pages was created with their css and js files. These pages are register.html and login.html. The validation of the user inputs was taken into consideration in both of the pages using JS. The form in the register.html does not submit/accept user inputs unless they are valid, and an alert messege is shown to the user if he registered sucessfully.

The product.html and product-details.html pages with their CSS and JS files were created to display the products of La Moda website. JSON was used in these pages to store the details of the products, and be able to manipulate the products.

The home page consists of the Navbar, the banner part (using GSAP), the categories section, and the footer. After designing the home page, the navbar and footer were applied to all of the other pages in the website.

The categories section in the home page is developed dynamically using JS. Same content of product.html page was taken and manipulated using a small piece of JS code, which calls a funtion to show the selected category and at the same time calls another function to hide the other category."display" attribute was used in order to achieve this.

In the product.html function, a cart button was added to allow user to add a specific product to his cart. This has been achieved sucessfully using JS.
